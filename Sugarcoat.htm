<h2>I'm not gonna sugarcoat it</h2>
<strong>
<p style="font-family:papyrus";>Except I will. 
</strong>
<br>The Royalguard Style is one of the most difficult styles to master but potentially one of the strongest. Though it is time-consuming to fill up the meter, Release and Just Release are two of the most damaging moves in the third and fourth games. These moves are powerful enough to kill almost all kinds of lesser demons, critically injure some of the larger demons, and inflict major damage to bosses.


In DMC3, the amount of power stored is indicated on the Style emblem.

In Devil May Cry 3, the amount of stored power is signified by the three jewel-like green lights on the Style emblem which are part of the display bar. They will first blink, then light on continuously as Dante collects Rage.




Devil May Cry 4 changed this for a more easily interpreted Rage Meter with segments that slowly fill as Rage is collected. Dante's next Release strike will be increased in power the more Rage he has built, and the maximum amount of Rage that can be stored is increased along with the Royalguard Style level. Devil May Cry 5 has a circular "Royal Gauge" divided into segments, starting out with four and upgrading to a full circle with ten segments. Acting similarly to Nero's Exceed system, the Rage meter is only effective for a single Release before needing to be refilled. The usage of Super Costumes provides an automatically replenishing Rage meter that restores to maximum in a very short time.

Dante can block lesser demons without breaking his 'blocking' stance. But larger demons with stronger attacks can break his normal guard. This can be dangerous because of long recovery times which leave Dante open for attack. In Devil May Cry 4, Dante's recovery time can be canceled by immediately performing Trickster's Dash. However, if mistimed, the strongest of the enemy attacks will crush right through the Block, ignoring it completely and causing Dante to suffer full damage despite the effort.

Interestingly, Royalguard is capable of completely countering and altering enemy tactics in a way that other Styles can't. For example, Block is capable of denying grab attempts, such as Nevan's kiss attack or Soul Eater's abduction. Blocks or Perfect Blocks can also protect against area attacks such as Vergil's Judgment Cut End, and even some automatic hits like Agnus' life-siphoning or Pandora's Omen form. It can also guard against counter-hits, such as the backfire damage from hitting a shielded Blitz with a melee attack. If an attack scores multiple hits, each hit can be Perfect Guarded.

Royalguard can generally only defend against attacks that actually deal damage: it does nothing against those that do not, such as the Leviathan heart's Red Orb or Devil Trigger drain, or Geryon's time-distorting attacks. There are some exceptions to this, such as the vortex phase of Goliath's swallow attack.

Royalguard in Devil May Cry 5 is much less punishing than in previous games, though contrary to many claims, the perfect guard timing window is exactly the same (6 frames). The main change is that regular guards no longer cause Dante to take chip damage: instead, a normal block will reduce Dante's DT gauge. If it is empty, Dante's guard will be broken: otherwise, Dante's guard is unbreakable. Normal Blocks also fill the Royal Gauge. Royal Block instead increases the DT gauge, provides a significant Style bonus, and fills the Royal Gauge more than a normal Block. Upgrading the Style now increases the size of the Royal Gauge, up to ten bars when the style is fully upgraded.

Royalguard no longer rotates Dante to face the enemy he is guarding: instead, he has multiple animations for guarding hits coming from different directions, and is even able to guard multiple hits with his back to an enemy. Dante also has voice cues that occasionally accompany perfect blocks, particularly if he has executed several in a row.



Royalguard's ultimate move has been changed once again from the Dreadnaught to a new move called "Royal Revenge." This move takes one segment of the Royal Gauge, and has Dante enter a "ready" stance: if an enemy strikes him in this stance, their hit is automatically nullified and Dante executes a powerful counter-hit which is like a low-damage Royal Release in terms of behavior. There is no timing requirement to Royal Revenge: as long as Dante is in the stance when he is struck, it will deal a hit.

When Royalguard is used with Devil Sword Dante's Swords Formation active, the summoned swords will reduce damage from all incoming blows Dante fails to block, and increase all gains to the Royal Gauge from blocking.

In Devil May Cry 4 and 5, when Dante chooses this style he will lower his posture into a braced position, leaning forward with his right arm and leg as if exaggerating a heater-shield guard stance, and shouts "Royal Guard!" while snapping his left hand behind him. An electrical aura sparks along with it: a pale blue tint in DMC4; glowing red in DMC5, similar to the other Styles.

<h2>Possible Origins of the Style Name</h2>
<p style="font-family:comic sans ms";>
The Royal Guard style name may stem from the British Royal Guard, described below

<br>
A royal guard is a group of military bodyguards, soldiers or armed retainers responsible for the protection of a royal family member, such as the emperor or empress, king or queen, or prince or princess. They often are an elite unit of the regular armed forces, or are designated as such, and may maintain special rights or privileges.

Institution and tasks

The Palace Guard by Ernst Rudolf.
Royal guards have historically comprised both purely ceremonial units serving in close proximity to the monarch, as well as regiments from all arms, forming a designated substantial elite and intended for active service as part of the army. An example of the first category would include the Tropas de la Casa Real of the Spanish monarchy prior to 1930, comprising halberderos and a mounted escort. Examples of the second would include the Imperial Guards of the Russian and German Empires prior to 1917â€“18.

Monarchs frequently modeled their royal guards upon those of fellow rulers. Thus, Napoleon I's Garde Imperiale was imitated by his opponent Alexander I of Russia, his Bourbon successor Louis XVIII, and his nephew Napoleon III. The modern Garderegiment Grenadiers en Jagers regiment of the Netherlands and the Escorte Royale of Belgium retain features of uniform and other distinctions that can be traced back to Napoleonic influences.
